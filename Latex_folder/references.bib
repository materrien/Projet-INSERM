By identifying genes that have cell cycle dependent expression in HaCaT human keratinocytes and comparing these with previously identified cell cycle genes, we have identified three distinct groups of cell cycle genes. First, housekeeping genes enriched for known cell cycle functions; second, cell type-specific genes enriched for HaCaT-specific functions; and third, Polycomb-regulated genes. These Polycomb-regulated genes are specifically upregulated during DNA replication, and consistent with being epigenetically silenced in other cell cycle phases, these genes have lower expression than other cell cycle genes. We also find similar patterns in foreskin fibroblasts, indicating that replication-dependent expression of Polycomb-silenced genes is a prevalent but unrecognized regulatory mechanism.}",

Alternatives to the original procedure have been proposed and some of these new methods are widely used.Results: The affy package is an R package of functions and classes for the analysis of oligonucleotide arrays manufactured by Affymetrix. The package is currently in its second release, affy provides the user with extreme flexibility when carrying out an analysis and make it possible to access and manipulate probe intensity data. In this paper, we present the main classes and functions in the package and demonstrate how they can be used to process probe-level data. We also demonstrate the importance of probe-level analysis when using the Affymetrix GeneChip platform.}",
